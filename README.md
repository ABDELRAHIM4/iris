# Iris Classification with Logistic Regression

ðŸš€ **Excited to share my latest project on GitHub!**

This project implements a logistic regression model using the Iris dataset to classify different species of iris flowers based on their features. This project showcases my skills in machine learning and data analysis.

## Overview
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning, containing measurements of iris flowers and their corresponding species. The goal of this project is to build a logistic regression model that accurately classifies the species based on the provided features.

## Key Features
- Utilized Python and scikit-learn for model training and evaluation.
- Achieved an accuracy of **100%** on the test set.
- Included a detailed classification report and confusion matrix for performance evaluation.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for running the code)

## Dataset
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, with four features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

The target variable is the species of the iris flower, which can be one of three classes:
- Iris Setosa
- Iris Versicolor
- Iris Virginica

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required libraries using pip:
